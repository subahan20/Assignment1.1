    <summary>Mahatma Gandhi</summary>
    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
      Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (ISO: Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī;[pron 1] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an
      Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the
      successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom
      across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South
      Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world
    </p>
    <h4>childhood</h4>
    <pre>
      As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about.
      One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."[16] The Indian classics, especially the stories of
      Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he states
      that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra
      to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is
      traceable to these epic characters.[17][18]

      The family's religious background was eclectic. Mohandas was born into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family.[19][20]
      Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family.[21][22]
      Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya.[23] His mother came from the medieval Krishna
      bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a
      collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran
      and the Bible.[22][24] Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who "would not think of
      taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To
      keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her.

  <summary>BR Ambedkar</summary>
  <h4>About</h4>
  <p>
    Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (Bhīmrāo Rāmjī Āmbēḍkar; 14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist,
    social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the
    Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and
    inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism
  </p>
  <h4>Education</h4>
  <pre>
    In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High
    School. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The match was arranged by
    the couple's parents, in accordance with prevailing custom at that time.[18]

    In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered Elphinstone College, which was
    affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he
    passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they
    considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of
    education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it
    was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family
    friend.[19]

    By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up
    employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had
    to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.
